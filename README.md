## What is this repository?

This repository contains four integrated MATLAB modules for analyzing key aspects of base isolation systems under seismic loading:

- **Hysteretic Behavior Characterization:** Quantifies energy dissipation capacity through effective stiffness (k_eff) and equivalent damping ratio (ξ_eff) calculations.
- **Orbital Displacement Analysis:** Compares theoretical vs. measured displacement paths using vector magnitude analysis.
- **Mass Displacement Statistics:** Computes maximum displacement vectors across historical earthquake records.
- **Design Parameter Curves**: Generates code-compliant shear-displacement relationships for isolation system design.

Developed following ASCE 7-16 guidelines and Chilean seismic code NCh2745, this toolkit enables comprehensive performance evaluation of isolation systems through standardized metrics.
